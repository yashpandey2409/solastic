Solatic: Real-time Solar Plant Monitoring and Consumption Tracking
üåü Overview
Solatic is an AI/ML-powered solution designed for real-time monitoring and insightful analysis of solar power generation. This project helps solar plant owners and operators understand their system's performance, predict energy yield, identify inefficiencies, and proactively detect operational anomalies. Beyond generation, Solatic also aims to incorporate consumption tracking for a holistic energy management view.
